I used to work in the BPO as a Customer Service Representative then later got promoted as a Realtime Analyst in Workforce Management Department. I am a Computer Engineering Graduate and realized I really want to get into the IT Industry, currently, I am an Associate Software Engineer at a company here in the Philippines but I think there is a lot I need to learn reason why I am putting effort and time to upskill, learn and acquire new skills.
